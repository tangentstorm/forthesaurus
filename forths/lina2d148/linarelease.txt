SYNOPSIS   
lina -- 32 bit figforth for linux
BLOCKS.BLK -- contains blocks for lina
toblocks.c fromblock.c -- convert block file to/from text file

DESCRIPTION 
`lina' is the linux version of the generic 86 figForth generated from
fig86.gnr. 

SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
The binary distribution `lina' runs without modification on any i86 linux. 
Building requires the nasm assembler.

FILES
Blocks are allocated in the file BLOCKS.BLK in the 
current directory. Run time switching to an other file is possible.

SOURCE
lina can be generated from its source `lina.asm' by
    nasm lina.asm -felf -o lina.o
    ld lina.o -o lina
The conversion programs can be generated by
    make toblocks fromblocks
The info file can be generated by
    make fig86.lina.info
and used by
    info -f fig86.lina.info

SYSTEM PROGRAMMING
If you need the value of mysterious symbolic constants in c
you can add them in the file stealconstant.c. 
After
    cc -E stealconstant.c | m4 prelude.m4 - > constant.m4 
you will find the value in constant.m4.
Sometimes you will find you need to add extra include directories
here, e.g. ``-I/usr/include/asm''.

SEE ALSO
There is a fig86.lina.html fig86.lina.texinfo
generated from a common source, and partly from the program
source. Installation information is present too, but should go
into a separate manual.

CAVEAT
This is a beta release.
BLOCKS.BLK is generic and contains source that may not run
on lina. In particular not the nice screen editor.
