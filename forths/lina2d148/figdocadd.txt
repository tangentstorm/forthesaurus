IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR lina

Blocks are allocated in a file called BLOCKS.BLK This name can be changed in
listing and also during run time. 
BLOCKS.BLK can be changed into an editable file and back by
cat BLOCKS.BLK | fromblocks > blocks.frt
cat blocks.frt | toblocks > BLOCKS.BLK
The user variable EM still is the end of the memory. 
The M4_EM in the configuration files is such that it designates the relative
size, from the relocatable start. Consequently it is not the same as the
user variable. (The relocatable start is some 128 Mbyte into the memory space.).
