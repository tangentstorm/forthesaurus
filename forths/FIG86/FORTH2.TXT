     The  following is a  sample MS-DOS terminal session in which 
the following operations occur:

          1.   A disk is formatted for later use by FORTH.
          2.   FORTH is started and used calculator-style.
          3.   DEBUG  is used to move the file FORTH.SCR  to  the
                    above formatted disk.
          4.    A new version of FORTH is created by loading some 
                    of the screens from the new disk.
          5.    DEBUG is used to save the new version of FORTH in 
                    the file 4TH.COM.
